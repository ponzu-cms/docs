These types must all reside in the \ncontent\n package and are the fundamental core of your CMS. In order for Content types to be rendered and managed by the CMS, they must implement the \neditor.Editable\n interface, and add add their own \ninterface{}\n container to the global \nitem.Types\n map. \n\n\nSound like alot?

SearchMapping()  is implemented with default mapping (ideal for 99% of use cases).   To enable search, add a  IndexContent() bool  method to your content type and return  true  (default implementation returns false).      Type  must implement  db.Searchable    Search is currently limited to single  Type  per request    Query String  doucmentation here:  Bleve Docs - Query String    Search results are formatted exactly the same as standard Content API calls, so you don't need to change your client data model      Search handler will respect other interface implementations on your content, including:    item.Hideable  item.Omittable    item.Pushable   (Note: only the first search result will be pushed)",

Typically this is done to set an ID to -1 indicating it is new for DB inserts, since by default a newly initialized struct would have an ID of 0, the int zero-value, and BoltDB's starting key per bucket is 0, thus overwriting the first record.\nMost notable, Identifiable\u2019s \nString\n method is used to set a meaningful display name for an Item. \nString\n is called by default in the Admin dashboard to show the Items of certain types, and in the default creation of an Item\u2019s slug.\nIdentifiable is implemented by Item by default.\n\n\nMethod Set\n\n\ntype\n \nIdentifiable\n \ninterface\n \n{\n\n    \nItemID\n()\n \nint\n\n    \nSetItemID\n(\nint\n)\n\n    \nUniqueID\n()\n \nuuid\n.\nUUID\n\n    \nString\n()\n \nstring\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\nitem.Identifiable\n has a default implementation in the \nsystem/item\n package. \nIt is not advised to override these methods, with the exception of \nString()\n, \nwhich is commonly used to set the display name of Content items when listed in \nthe CMS, and to customize slugs.\n\n\nfunc\n \n(\ni\n \nItem\n)\n \nItemID\n()\n \nint\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \ni\n.\nID\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunc\n \n(\ni\n \n*\nItem\n)\n \nSetItemID\n(\nid\n \nint\n)\n \n{\n\n    \ni\n.\nID\n \n=\n \nid\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunc\n \n(\ni\n \nItem\n)\n \nUniqueID\n()\n \nuuid\n.\nUUID\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \ni\n.\nUUID\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunc\n \n(\ni\n \nItem\n)\n \nString\n()\n \nstring\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nfmt\n.\nSprintf\n(\nItem ID: %s\n,\n \ni\n.\nUniqueID\n())\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitem.Sluggable\n\n\nSluggable makes a struct locatable by URL with it's own path. As an Item implementing Sluggable, slugs may overlap. If this is an issue, make your content struct (or one which embeds Item) implement Sluggable and it will override the slug created by Item's \nSetSlug\n method with your own.\nIt is not recommended to override \nSetSlug\n, but rather the \nString\n method on your content struct, which will have a similar, more predictable effect.\nSluggable is implemented by Item by default.\n\n\nMethod Set\n\n\ntype\n \nSluggable\n \ninterface\n \n{\n\n    \nSetSlug\n(\nstring\n)\n\n    \nItemSlug\n()\n \nstring\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\n\nitem.Sluggable\n has a default implementation in the \nsystem/item\n package. It is\npossible to override these methods on your own Content types, but beware, behavior\nis undefined. It is tempting to override the \nSetSlug()\n method to customize your\nContent item slug, but try first to override the \nString()\n method found in the\n\nitem.Identifiable\n interface instead.
